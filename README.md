## License Plate Recognition System Overview

The License Plate Recognition (LPR) System is a Python-based application designed to detect and recognize characters on license plates from images. It employs computer vision techniques and image processing algorithms to segment characters, perform template matching, and ultimately extract license plate information.

### Key Components

1. **Image Segmentation**: The system begins by segmenting the license plate image to isolate individual characters. This process involves converting the image to grayscale, applying thresholding techniques to create a binary image, and detecting contours of potential characters.

2. **Character Recognition**: Once the characters are segmented, the system utilizes template matching to recognize each character. Template matching involves comparing each character candidate with predefined templates to determine the best match.

3. **Visualization**: Throughout the process, the system provides visual feedback by drawing rectangles around detected characters and displaying the matched templates. This aids in understanding the detection and recognition results.
